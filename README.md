# FingerPrintAnalysis
Third project for biometry 

A comparative study of thinning algorithms applied to fingerprint images, focusing on ridge skeletonization and minutiae detection.

## Overview

This project implements and compares two different thinning algorithms for fingerprint ridge processing:
- **Morphological Skeletonization** - classical morphological approach presented in the lecture
- **K3M Algorithm** - iterative thinning method

## Features

- Implementation of two distinct thinning algorithms
- Additional morphological operations for result enhancement
- Ridge line connectivity improvement for broken thinned ridges
- Automatic minutiae detection and localization:
 - Ridge endings (terminations)
 - Ridge bifurcations

## Implementation

The project applies various image processing techniques to optimize fingerprint ridge analysis:
- Morphological skeletonization algorithm as presented in the lecture
- K3M thinning algorithm for comparative analysis
- Morphological operations for noise reduction
- Ridge connectivity restoration
- Minutiae extraction from skeletonized images

## Algorithms Used

- **Lecture-based morphological skeletonization** for fingerprint ridge detection
- **K3M thinning algorithm** for alternative ridge structure analysis
- Additional morphological operations for image enhancement

## Usage

The algorithms process fingerprint images to produce thinned ridge structures, enabling accurate minutiae detection for biometric applications.
